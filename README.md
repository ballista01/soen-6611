# Deliverable

PROBLEM 1: Using the **Goal-Question-Metric (GQM)** approach (or one of its extensions), present one goal specific to METRICSTICS and articulate 2N questions related to that goal, where N is the team size. Discuss whether any metrics help answer those questions. 

NOTES The goals must aim to be SMART. 

PROBLEM 2: Using the given description, construct a use case model for METRICSTICS. This construction must be accompanied by definitions of actors and use cases, and descriptions of use case scenarios.

# Task Allocation

Throughout the completion of Deliverable 1, every team member was entrusted with an equitable distribution of responsibilities. We divided the deliverable into modules, ensuring that each team member was tasked with the implementation of a specific section. This approach was employed to promote a balanced workload and facilitate a collaborative effort towards achieving the Deliverable's objectives by making sure that each team member has participated in implementing the Problem1,Problem2,LaTex report.
