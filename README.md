  ### Introduction
  
  This document outlines the guidelines for our university project, which involves the implementation of a software deliverable using Python. Each team member is expected to actively contribute to the project by learning and implementing specific code segments or blocks. To ensure the project's success, effective communication and proactive problem-solving are crucial.
  
  ### Learning and Implementation
  
  1. **Python Proficiency**: Each team member is responsible for gaining proficiency in Python programming. This includes understanding Python syntax, libraries, and best practices.
  
  2. **Code Segments/Blocks**: Assignments for specific code segments or blocks will be made by the team. Each team member should thoroughly understand the assigned code segment and implement it effectively.
  
  3. **Collaborative Learning**: While individual learning is encouraged, team members are also encouraged to collaborate and assist each other in understanding and implementing code segments.
  
  ### Communication
  
  4. **Regular Updates**: Team members must proactively communicate their progress to the team. Regular status updates should be provided through the designated communication channel (e.g., Slack, email, or team meetings).
  
  5. **Progress Reporting**: Status updates should include information on the code segments implemented, any challenges faced, and the expected timeline for completion.
  
  6. **Transparency**: Maintain transparency in your work. Share code snippets, documentation, and any relevant resources with the team to facilitate knowledge sharing.
  
  ### Problem Identification and Resolution
  
  7. **Blockers**: If you encounter any issues or blockers while working on your assigned code segments, it is your responsibility to promptly inform the team. Clearly describe the problem and seek assistance.
  
  8. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Team members should collaborate to resolve blockers. Discuss potential solutions, seek input from others, and work together to overcome challenges.
  
  9. **Escalation**: If a problem cannot be resolved by you, escalate it to the team immediately for support.
  
  ### Project Ownership
  
  10. **Accountability**: Each team member is accountable for the successful implementation of their assigned code segments. Take ownership of your work and ensure it aligns with project goals.
  
  11. **Quality Assurance**: Prioritize code quality, readability, and adherence to coding standards. Conduct testing and debugging as needed to deliver reliable code.
  
  ### Deadlines
  
  12. **Timely Completion**: Adhere to project timelines and deadlines. Inform the team in advance if you anticipate delays due to unforeseen circumstances.
  
  13. **Task Handover**: If you complete your assigned code segment ahead of schedule, be prepared to assist other team members or take on additional tasks as needed.

# Deliverable 1

PROBLEM 1: Using the **Goal-Question-Metric (GQM)** approach (or one of its extensions), present one goal specific to METRICSTICS and articulate 2N questions related to that goal, where N is the team size. Discuss whether any metrics help answer those questions. 

NOTES The goals must aim to be SMART. 

PROBLEM 2: Using the given description, construct a use case model for METRICSTICS. This construction must be accompanied by definitions of actors and use cases, and descriptions of use case scenarios.

# Task Allocation

Throughout the completion of Deliverable 1, every team member was entrusted with an equitable distribution of responsibilities. We divided the deliverable into modules, ensuring that each team member was tasked with the implementation of a specific section. This approach was employed to promote a balanced workload and facilitate a collaborative effort towards achieving the Deliverable's objectives by making sure that each team member has participated in implementing the Problem1, Problem2 and LaTex report.
