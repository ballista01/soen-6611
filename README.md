# Task Allocation

Throughout the completion of Deliverable 1, every team member was entrusted with an equitable distribution of responsibilities. We divided the deliverable into modules, ensuring that each team member was tasked with the implementation of a specific section. This approach was employed to promote a balanced workload and facilitate a collaborative effort towards achieving the Deliverable's objectives by making sure that each team member has participated in implementing the Problem1,Problem2,LaTex report.
