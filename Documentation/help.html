            <p>
                The Metricstics system is a sophisticated tool designed to calculate descriptive statistics, providing users with insights into measures of central tendency, frequency, and variability within datasets. It encapsulates the functionality to compute minimum, maximum, mode, median, mean, mean absolute deviation (MAD), standard deviation, and variance, catering to both basic and advanced user profiles.

            <h2>Using the Metricstics Application</h2>
            <p>
                The Metricstics application offers an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) designed for ease of use, allowing users to effortlessly input data, select statistical calculations, and manage sessions. Whether you are a first-time user or returning for further analysis, the process is streamlined for an efficient user experience.
            </p>
            <img src="1.jpeg" alt="Statistics Calculator GUI" class="screenshot">
            <h3>For New Users</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Upon launch, the GUI will display a text widget for data entry and a selection of checkboxes for various statistical operations such as Min, Max, Mode, etc.</li>
                <li>For <strong>first-time users</strong>, begin by selecting a profile â€” 'Basic' or 'Advanced'. This pre-selects a standard set of statistical calculations for convenience.</li>
                <li>Input your dataset as comma-separated values in the text field or use the 'Load CSV From File' button to upload a CSV file directly.</li>
                <li>Customize your selection of statistics by checking or unchecking the options as needed.</li>
                <li>Click 'Calculate' to execute the selected operations and the results will be displayed adjacent to the corresponding checkboxes.</li>
                <li>To save the current session's data, click the 'Save' button. Your data will be stored for future reference.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For Returning Users</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the 'Restore' button to retrieve your last saved session's data.</li>
                <li>Continue with the analysis by performing additional calculations or modifying the dataset as required.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Users can clear the session data and results by clicking the 'Clear' button, which resets the text widget and deselects all operation checkboxes. For any further assistance or to report issues, please refer to the 'Support' section of this documentation.
